# Emory Hacks

Each year's website lives in its own branch. For example, the website for the 2025 hackathon is located in the `2025` branch.

## Branches

- `main`: The main branch contains the latest version of the website.
- `gh-pages`: The branch to deploy static outputs of all websites.
- `2026`: The branch for the 2026 hackathon.
- `2025`: The branch for the 2025 hackathon.
